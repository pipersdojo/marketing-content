  <h2>The Burger Story</h2>
  <p><strong>If any of the below statements are true, you owe it to yourself to hear me out:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>I feel frustrated and/or "burned out" because it takes me so long to learn bagpipe tunes.</li>
    <li>Even when I do learn a tune, it never comes out sounding good.</li>
    <li>I believe I can't be a good piper because I can't memorize tunes no matter how hard I try.</li>
    <li>I can't figure out how to improve my existing material. I think the only way for me to get better is to hire an instructor to help me.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>If any of these statements are true for you, you need to read on. Let's start with a hamburger analogy.</p>

  <h3>How long does it take you to make a hamburger?</h3>
  <p>It takes me a long time to make a hamburger. What type of ground beef do I buy? Do I use eggs in the mixture? Breadcrumbs? Do I cook this thing on the stove or on the grill? At what temperature? What cheese should I use? What bun should I use? What should I serve on the side?</p>
  <p>By the time I've figured it all out, it takes... at best... an hour to get home-made burgers on the table. And the sad part? When I bite into it I think to myself... "I should have just gone to MacDonald's."</p>
  
  <p>Recap: It took me forever, and in the end, I didn't do a very good job!</p>

  <p>This is a great analogy for what happens when people attempt to learn a bagpipe tune. You're spending a long time trying to learn it, and in the end, it's the furthest thing from a masterpiece.</p>
  
  <p>Stick with me on the hamburger analogy. Now, I know a lot of folks don't like MacDonald's— but let's suspend our disbelief just for a moment and pretend they make the perfect burger.</p>
  
  <p>I just asked Google, and it told me that MacDonald's makes a quarter-pounder-with-cheese in 180 seconds flat. And, it comes out so well (every time) that the MacDonald's restaurants across the globe crank out 75 burgers PER SECOND, every single day, for hungry eaters everywhere.</p>
  
  <p><strong>My burger approach:</strong> Long time, poor result.<br><strong>MacDonald's approach:</strong> Three Minutes, excellent (consistent!) result.</p>
  
  <p>What is the difference between my approach and MacDonald's approach? It's not some sort of "genius factor." Burgers are pretty simple in concept.</p>
  
  <p>Rather, it's the fact that MacDonald's employs a repeatable system for making their burgers, while I am "winging" the process and hoping for the best.</p>
  
  <p>By tweaking the system over and over again, they have drastically shortened the time it takes to create their product, and they do it without sacrificing any quality.</p>

  <h3>As Bagpipers, our "Product" is our Tunes.</h3>
  <p>If MacDonald's primary job is to make burgers, ours is to play tunes! If we can't learn and play tunes well, we're never going to make it. We're going to burn out. We're going to stagnate. Many of us quit.</p>
  
  <p>So, how do you learn a tune, in a short time, with excellent quality?</p>
  <p><strong>Be like MacDonald's – SYSTEMATIZE!</strong></p>
  
  <p>That's what the tune-building process is all about – the systematization of learning bagpipe tunes. Once we have a system, we can tweak it so we can do it faster and better. And then we do it again. And then again.</p>
  
  <p>The best players in the world that can learn and retain thousands of tunes at a time – it's because they've devised their own internal systems for getting the job done quickly and effectively. Now it's your turn.</p>

  <h3>Introducing Our Tune-Building Success Plan Course</h3>
  <p>The great news for you is that you don't have to start from square one. Our new Tune-Building Success Plan Course is a distillation of our own process, that we've already tweaked over and over again, that allows players of any level to skyrocket the rate at which they can expand their repertoire.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>How to <strong>save tons of time</strong> and drastically reduce frustration in the tune-learning process by breaking down tunes the right way.</li>
    <li>How <strong>not to waste a single second</strong> of your time, by organizing the process of tune-learning so you'll always know exactly what to be focusing on, and when.</li>
    <li>How to <strong>actually get better when you learn a tune</strong> by perfecting each tune-segment layer by layer before moving on. (And yes, this will actually SAVE you time in the long-run)</li>
    <li>How to <strong>quickly memorize any tune</strong> by simply applying the same tune-building process!</li>
    <li>How to <strong>improve existing tunes in your repertoire</strong> on auto-pilot.</li>
    <li>We'll also build 6 classic bagpipe tunes together to get you key experience with the process before setting you free to do it on your own.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This “Video Success Plan,” an online video course that is easily accessed on any device, will set you up to learn any tune <strong>twice as fast</strong> as you could before, and <strong>twice as well</strong>.</p>
