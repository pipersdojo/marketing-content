  <h2>The Burger Story</h2>
  <p><strong>If any of the below statements are true, you owe it to yourself to hear me out:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>I feel frustrated and/or "burned out" because it takes me so long to learn bagpipe tunes.</li>
    <li>Even when I do learn a tune, it never comes out sounding good.</li>
    <li>I believe I can't be a good piper because I can't memorize tunes no matter how hard I try.</li>
    <li>I can't figure out how to improve my existing material. I think the only way for me to get better is to hire an instructor to help me.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>If any of these statements are true for you, you need to read on. Let's start with a hamburger analogy.</p>

  <h3>How long does it take you to make a hamburger?</h3>
  <p>It takes me a long time to make a hamburger. What type of ground beef do I buy? Do I use eggs in the mixture? Breadcrumbs? Do I cook this thing on the stove or on the grill? At what temperature? What cheese should I use? What bun should I use? What should I serve on the side?</p>
  <p>By the time I've figured it all out, it takes... at best... an hour to get home-made burgers on the table. And the sad part? When I bite into it I think to myself... "I should have just gone to MacDonald's".</p>

  <h3>Recap:</h3>
  <p>It took me forever, and in the end I didn't do a very good job!</p>
  <p>This is a great analogy for what happens when people attempt to learn a bagpipe tune. You're spending a long time trying to learn it, and in the end it's the furthest thing from a masterpiece.</p>

  <h3>Stick with me on the hamburger analogy.</h3>
  <p>Now, I know a lot of folks don't like MacDonald's — but let's suspend our disbelief just for a moment and pretend they make the perfect burger.</p>

  <h3>The Difference:</h3>
  <p>MacDonald's employs a repeatable system for making their burgers, while I am "winging" the process and hoping for the best. By tweaking the system over and over again, they have drastically shortened the time it takes to create their product, and they do it without sacrificing any quality.</p>

  <h3>As Bagpipers, our "Product" is our Tunes.</h3>
  <p>If MacDonald's primary job is to make burgers, ours is to play tunes! If we can't learn and play tunes well, we're never going to make it. We're going to burn out, we're going to stagnate, and many of us quit.</p>

  <h3>So, how do you learn a tune, in a short time, with excellent quality?</h3>
  <p><strong>Be like MacDonald's — SYSTEMATIZE!</strong> That's what the tune-building process is all about — the systematization of learning bagpipe tunes. Once we have a system, we can tweak it so we can do it faster and better. And then we do it again. And then again.</p>
