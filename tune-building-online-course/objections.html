    <h2>I don't believe in online lessons</h2>
    <p>Believe me, you're not the first person to have doubts about the effectiveness of online bagpipe lessons.</p>
    <p>Our school is indeed a big shift from the typical <strong>"master-->apprentice"</strong> approach to teaching bagpipes.</p>
    <p>It is true, some of the <strong>"in person magic"</strong> that you can get from a truly great solo lesson or group session might not seem as magical in an online setting.</p>
    
    <h3>The Thought Experiment</h3>
    <p>All of these difficult challenges crossed my mind one beautiful day in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. I was daydreaming about bagpipe stuff and thought:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        "What if somehow we could make it work? What would be gained?"
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Imagine:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bagpiping experiences all year round instead of just one week!</li>
        <li>A much more affordable option than traditional bagpipe camps.</li>
        <li>Accessible from anywhere in the world, with no travel stress!</li>
        <li>Building a supportive community that grows together.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Just over a decade ago, it became clear that I couldn't afford not to try to build the world's first <strong>"online bagpipe school."</strong></p>
    
    <h3>Advantages vs Disadvantages of Online Bagpipe Learning</h3>
    <p>Dojo University is a fantastic product for bagpipers with and without access to in-person instruction:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>World-class instruction from the comfort of home.</li>
        <li>Hundreds of weekly learning opportunities, not just one.</li>
        <li>A large community of like-minded, music-first bagpipers.</li>
        <li>An endless archive of recorded classes, courses, and articles.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yes, there are challenges, but they make you a better student:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You’ll need to be self-motivated and prepared to work a little each day.</li>
        <li>Some skills might require <em>"hands on"</em> help which is more challenging online.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>I don't have the time or energy to practice</h2>
    <p>Totally understand that feeling &mdash; life is so full. But here’s the honest truth: most people don’t actually lack time. They lack results that feel worth the time.</p>
    
    <p>You know? People find time for Netflix, family, and other hobbies &mdash; and that’s awesome. But bagpiping often gets pushed aside because it hasn’t been delivering a return on that time.</p>
    
    <h3>But... what if that changed?</h3>
    <p>What if every minute you practiced moved the needle in a real, tangible way?</p>
    <p>What if this time next month, you were sounding better, playing more confidently, and enjoying your music again?</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>If the result felt real &mdash; would you find the time then?</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Because that’s exactly what we’re offering: a system that finally makes it click. And when it clicks, people want to make the time.</p>
