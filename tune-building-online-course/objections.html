    <h2>I don't believe in online lessons</h2>
    <p><strong>Don't believe</strong> in online bagpipe lessons? You're not alone! Many share the same doubt about the efficacy of learning through a screen.</p>
    <p>While the traditional "master-to-apprentice" approach shines in its personal touch, it's not the only path to mastery. Here at our school, we've built a unique alternative, one that embraces innovation and accessibility.</p>
    <p>Let me take you on a brief journey:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Back in 2011, while on my honeymoon in Playa del Carmen, a thought struck me: <strong>What if we brought the magic of bagpipe camps online?</strong> Imagine not just a week of learning, but ongoing support, a community growing together, and world-class instruction accessible from home.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The reality may present challenges — and I acknowledge that there are skills which require hands-on guidance. However, the benefits of our online approach far outweigh these limitations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**World-class teaching** from the comfort of your home.</li>
        <li>No travel hassle, no gas money, and importantly, no health risks.</li>
        <li>Access to a large, vibrant community of fellow pipers.</li>
        <li>Hundreds of weekly learning opportunities—far beyond the one a year at camps.</li>
        <li>An endless archive of recorded classes and valuable resources.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many have transformed from novices to advanced pipers through our online platform, and with the right mindset, you can too!</p>
