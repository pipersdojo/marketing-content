    <h2>I don't believe in online lessons</h2>
    <p><strong>Believe me, you're not the first person to have doubts</strong> about the effectiveness of online bagpipe lessons.</p>
    <p>Our school is indeed a big shift from the typical <em>“master-apprentice”</em> approach to teaching bagpipes.</p>
    <p>It’s true that some of the <strong>“in-person magic”</strong> might not seem as magical in an online setting.</p>
    
    <h3>The Thought Experiment</h3>
    <p>Imagine this: one beautiful day in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, I pondered the benefits of an online bagpipe school. What if we could bring the joy of bagpipe camp to everyone, year-round?</p>
    
    <p>Here’s what I envisioned:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessible learning</strong> from the comfort of your home.</li>
        <li>No more travel expenses or time away from loved ones.</li>
        <li>A continuous journey of improvement, not limited to just one week per year.</li>
        <li>A vibrant community of pipers learning and growing together over time.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>And that became a reality with <strong>Dojo U</strong>. This system ensures you can learn at your own pace, with world-class instruction at your fingertips.</p>
    
    <h3>Advantages vs Disadvantages of Online Bagpipe Learning</h3>
    <p><strong>Dojo University</strong> is perfect for bagpipers, no matter their situation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Those without access to local instruction can start from scratch and progress to advanced levels.</li>
        <li>Those with local instruction can enhance their learning and develop a well-rounded skill set.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>The Pros List</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>World-class instruction from home</li>
        <li>No commute or travel costs</li>
        <li>A large community of like-minded pipers</li>
        <li>Hundreds of learning opportunities weekly</li>
        <li>An endless archive of resources</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>The Cons List</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Not in the same physical space as your instructor</li>
        <li>Some hands-on skills are more challenging online</li>
        <li>Self-motivation is essential</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>I don't have the time or energy to practice</h2>
    <p><strong>Totally understand that feeling — life is full!</strong> But here’s the honest truth: most people don’t actually lack time; they lack results that feel worth the time.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Think about it</strong>: People find time for Netflix, family, and other hobbies. But bagpiping often gets pushed aside because it hasn’t delivered a return.</p>
    
    <p>Imagine if that changed. What if every minute you practiced led to real, tangible improvements?</p>
    
    <p><strong>*This time next month*,</strong> you could be sounding better, playing more confidently, and genuinely enjoying your music!</p>
    
    <p>If those results felt real, would you find the time then?</p>
    
    <p>Because that’s exactly what we’re offering: a system that finally makes it click. Once it does, you will want to make time for bagpiping.</p>
