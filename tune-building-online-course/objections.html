    <h2>I don't believe in online lessons</h2>
    <p><strong>Don't Believe</strong> in Online Bagpipe Lessons?<br>
    Believe me, you're not the first person to have doubts about the effectiveness of online bagpipe lessons.</p>
    <p>Our school is indeed a big shift from the typical <em>master-apprentice</em> approach to teaching bagpipes. It is indeed harder to teach certain skills over the internet (as we can't do much that's truly <em>hands on</em>). It's true, some of the <strong>in person magic</strong> that you can get from a truly great solo lesson or group session might not seem to be as magical in an online setting.</p>
    
    <h3>The Thought Experiment</h3>
    <p>All of these difficult challenges indeed crossed my mind one beautiful day in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. It was the year 2011 and my wife and I were on our honeymoon...</p>
    
    <p>So, just over a decade ago, it became clear that I couldn't afford not to try to build the world's first <strong>online bagpipe school</strong>. And so that's what I did (with the help of my extremely talented team, and amazing world-class instructors).</p>

    <h3>Advantages vs Disadvantages of Online Bagpipe Learning</h3>
    <p>Dojo University is a fantastic product for bagpipers with and without access to in-person instruction:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bagpipers without access</strong> to in-person instruction can utilize Dojo U to ascend from the very first day picking up a practice chanter to becoming an advanced bagpiper.</li>
        <li><strong>Bagpipers with access</strong> can supplement their in-person lessons with the Dojo, helping to develop a more rounded skillset.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Pros List</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>World-class instruction from the comfort of home</li>
        <li>No gas money, no battling bad weather, no commute - and let's not forget, no health risks!</li>
        <li>Immerse yourself in a large community of like-minded, music-first bagpipers</li>
        <li>Hundreds of weekly learning opportunities (not just one)</li>
        <li>An endless archive of recorded classes, courses, articles, and more</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Cons List</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Not in the same physical space as your instructor.</li>
        <li>Some skills that require "hands-on" help are more challenging online.</li>
        <li>You're going to have to be self-motivated and be ready to work a little bit each day.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>I don't have the time or energy to practice</h2>
    <p><strong>Totally understand that feeling</strong> — life is so full. But here’s the honest truth: most people don’t actually lack time; they lack results that feel worth the time.</p>
    <p>You know? People find time for Netflix, family, other hobbies — and that’s awesome. But bagpiping often gets pushed aside because it hasn’t been delivering a return on that time.</p>
    <p><strong>But... what if that changed?</strong><br>
    What if every minute you practiced moved the needle in a real, tangible way? What if this time next month, you were sounding better, playing more confidently, and enjoying your music again?</p>
    <p>If the result felt real — would you find the time then? Because that’s exactly what we’re offering: a system that finally makes it click. And when it clicks, people want to make the time.</p>
