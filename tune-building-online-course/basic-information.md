- **Promotion Name**: Tune Building Success Plan - Flash Sale
- **Product Summary**: A systematic approach to learning bagpipe tunes that doesn't just help you learn the tune, it helps you become a better piper in the process. Main thesis: the reason people struggle learning tunes is that they dive in willy-nilly, without a plan. Just a basic plan can make all the difference. This is the plan I (Andrew Douglas) use to systematically learn tunes. As a result, learning tunes becomes fast, fun, and I get better as a piper every time I look at a new tune.
