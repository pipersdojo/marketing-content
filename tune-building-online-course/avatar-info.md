The ideal customer for our offering primarily consists of adult learners who have recently developed a passion for bagpiping later in life, and they often face challenges in mastering tunes in a timely manner, particularly struggling with memorization. Despite their dedication in terms of both time and finances, they find it difficult to keep pace with their peers, leading to feelings of inadequacy as they fear that their efforts may ultimately prove futile, especially when explaining their struggles to loved ones. With a burgeoning amount of bagpipe-related information available, these learners still find it hard to effectively learn tunes, driving a strong desire for a more enjoyable and efficient method to learn and connect with their band mates through music. They seek a solution that offers a faster and more enjoyable path to musical proficiency, contrasting sharply with the existing tutorials that often fail to address their specific learning needs.
