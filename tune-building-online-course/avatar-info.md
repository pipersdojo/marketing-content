The ideal customer for our product is typically an adult learner who has embraced bagpiping later in life, viewing it as a passion project despite the challenges they face. These individuals often struggle to learn tunes in a timely manner and find themselves unable to memorize the music, which leads to feelings of inadequacy as they compare themselves to other pipers. They harbor fears that they may not succeed in their efforts, questioning whether their significant investments of time and money will ultimately prove fruitless, and worry about admitting their struggles to their spouses. While there is a growing trend of accessible bagpipe information available to them, they find that achieving mastery of tunes remains elusive. Their primary desire is to express themselves freely through music and enjoy piping alongside their band mates. This customer is impatient for results, seeking a faster way to learn tunes, as existing tutorials fall short of providing effective and enjoyable learning experiences. The overarching goal for this customer is to find a solution that simplifies their learning journey and alleviates the frustrations they face, enabling them to genuinely enjoy their passion for bagpiping.
