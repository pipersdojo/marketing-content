The ideal customer avatar primarily consists of adult learners who have taken up bagpiping as a passion project later in life, often facing challenges in mastering tunes effectively and within a reasonable timeframe. These individuals struggle with memorization, which hinders their ability to keep pace with fellow pipers, leading to feelings of inadequacy and fears that their investments in time and money may be in vain. They find themselves increasingly overwhelmed by the abundance of bagpipe information available, yet they still grapple with successfully learning tunes. Their desire is to express themselves freely through piping and to enjoy making music alongside their bandmates. However, they are frustrated by the slow progress they experience and are looking for a more enjoyable and efficient way to learn tunes, ideally through resources that teach any tune rather than the limited options currently available.
