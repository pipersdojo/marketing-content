    <h2>I don't believe in online lessons</h2>
    <p><strong>Don't Believe</strong> in Online Bagpipe Lessons? Believe me, you're not the first person to have doubts about the effectiveness of online bagpipe lessons.</p>
    <p>Our school is indeed a big shift from the typical <em>"master to apprentice"</em> approach to teaching bagpipes.</p>
    <p>It's indeed harder to teach certain skills over the internet, as we can't do much that's truly <em>hands-on.</em> It's true, some of the <strong>"in-person magic"</strong> might not seem as magical in an online setting.</p>
    
    <h3>The Thought Experiment</h3>
    <p>All of these challenging doubts crossed my mind one beautiful day in Playa del Carmen. It was 2011 — just my wife and I on our honeymoon, sipping cocktails, and daydreaming.</p>
    <p>I recalled my love for bagpipe camp as a kid, and I realized:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>If we could bring a bagpipe camp online, imagine the possibilities!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And so, over a decade ago, I took the leap: <strong>to build the world's first online bagpipe school.</strong></p>
    
    <h3>Advantages vs Disadvantages of Online Bagpipe Learning</h3>
    <p>Dojo University is a fantastic product for bagpipers with and without access to in-person instruction:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>World-class instruction from the comfort of home</li>
        <li>No travel necessary, whether you're near or far</li>
        <li>No gas money, battling bad weather, or health risks!</li>
        <li><strong>Hundreds of weekly learning opportunities</strong> at your fingertips</li>
        <li>An endless archive of recorded classes, courses, articles, and more</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Yes, ideally, the online experience isn’t <strong>exactly</strong> the same as being right there with your instructor.</em> But with self-motivation and a little daily practice, you'll unlock your potential like never before!</p>

    <h2>I don't have the time or energy to practice</h2>
    <p><strong>Totally understand that feeling</strong> — life is so full! But here’s the honest truth: most people don’t actually lack time. They lack results that feel worth the time.</p>
    <p>People find time for Netflix, family, other hobbies — and that’s awesome. But bagpiping often gets pushed aside because it hasn’t been delivering a return on that time.</p>
    
    <h3>What if that changed?</h3>
    <p>What if every minute you practiced moved the needle in a real, tangible way? What if this time next month, you were:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sounding better</li>
        <li>Playing more confidently</li>
        <li>Enjoying your music again</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the result felt real — would you find the time then? Because that’s exactly what we’re offering: <strong>a system that <em>finally makes it click.</em></strong></p>
