            <p>Other piping workshops might have the instructor “demonstrate” tuning, but this workshop actually trains pipers how to tune their own pipes through efficient, tried and true techniques.</p>

            <p>This was a fantastic experience that challenged me as a piper and helped me improve in several areas. My tuning skills are already showing improvement, and performing for my peers was a huge growth opportunity for me. There was so much packed into 3 days - much more than I originally envisioned. A great experience and highly recommended to anyone who wants to experience a huge growth spurt in their piping skills.</p>
