    <h2>The price is too high</h2>
    <p>That’s totally fair — but let’s unpack what <strong>$449</strong> actually gets you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Real Skill Transformation (Not Just “A Few Tips”)</strong><br>
        This isn’t a weekend of random classes — it’s three full days of structured, in-person coaching designed to completely rebuild your piping foundation, Dojo-style. That means:
        <ul>
            <li>We’ll start from square one with fingerwork and instrument fundamentals, no matter your level.</li>
            <li>You’ll walk away with a clear, repeatable process for blowing steady, playing cleanly, and sounding great.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Extremely Small Groups = Massive Value</strong><br>
        This workshop caps at just 24 people, and we’re bringing three top-tier instructors: myself (Andrew), Carl, and our special guest Griffin Hall. That’s basically a 6:1 student-teacher ratio — unheard of in most piping events. You’ll get direct, personalized feedback every day.</li>
        <li><strong>Printed Materials to Keep Forever</strong><br>
        You’ll receive a professionally printed workbook to take home — a reference for everything we cover, so you can keep building long after the weekend ends.</li>
        <li><strong>Seamless Connection to Winter Storm</strong><br>
        This workshop runs the 3 days leading into Winter Storm, in the same hotel. That means you can just extend your hotel stay and roll straight into the piping event of the year — we even offer discounted Winter Storm registration right on our page.</li>
        <li><strong>Great Piping and Great BBQ</strong><br>
        You’re not just coming for the tunes. We’re including a group BBQ lunch at our favorite Kansas City spot, and you’ll have time to soak in the city’s food, music, and culture. It’s a true getaway experience with like-minded pipers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When you add it all up, <strong>$449</strong> for three days of elite, focused coaching with a small group, printed materials, meals, and a seamless Winter Storm lead-in is actually a steal.</p>
    <p>We’ve designed this to deliver months of progress in a single weekend. If you’re ready to break bad habits, gain confidence, and finally enjoy piping more — this is the event for you.</p>

    <h2>It's too far to travel</h2>
    <p>Totally get it — travel can feel like a big lift. But here’s why this trip is more manageable (and more rewarding) than you might think:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flights to Kansas City Are Actually Pretty Simple</strong><br>
        Kansas City is a central hub with lots of direct, affordable flights — especially in January, which is a low-travel season. Airports and airfare are way calmer and cheaper than during the holidays.<br>
        Plus, our workshop is hosted right at the Kansas City Marriott, just 30 minutes from the airport. No rental car needed. Just Uber in and you’re all set.</li>
        <li><strong>You’ll Leave with Friends, Not Just Notes</strong><br>
        Piping can be a lonely journey — but not here. This weekend is built for connection:
        <ul>
            <li>You’ll meet fellow pipers from all over the country who are serious about improving.</li>
            <li>You’ll be learning shoulder-to-shoulder in small, encouraging groups.</li>
            <li>And we’ll even take you out for legendary Kansas City BBQ to bond over brisket and drones.</li>
        </ul>
        The relationships you build here often turn into lasting friendships, practice partners, and motivators — both online and at future events.</li>
        <li><strong>Two Birds, One Plane Ticket</strong><br>
        Here’s the real kicker: If you stay a few more days, you’ll roll right into Winter Storm — North America’s biggest solo piping and drumming weekend. Same hotel, same bed, no extra travel planning.
        <ul>
            <li>You’ll hear the world’s best pipers perform live.</li>
            <li>You can attend more workshops, compete if you’d like, or just soak it all in.</li>
            <li>And if you register for Winter Storm through our event page, you’ll even get a discount.</li>
        </ul>
        So yeah — it’s a trip. But it’s also a transformational weekend, a chance to connect deeply with your instrument, and your people. You’ll go home a better piper — and probably with a few new friends for life.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>It's too cold in the winter</h2>
    <p>Sure — it’s winter. But let’s be honest: you’re not coming for the sunshine ☀️ — you’re coming to make real progress on your piping 🎶.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>You’ll Be Cozy the Whole Time</strong><br>
        We’re hosting the entire workshop inside the Kansas City Marriott — it’s warm, comfortable, and everything happens in the same building. You can literally take the elevator from your room to class. No trudging through snow, no sketchy travel between venues — just great piping in a warm, cozy setting.</li>
        <li><strong>The Piping Will Be Hot, Even if the Weather Isn’t</strong><br>
        You’ll be deep in hands-on instruction with world-class teachers. The rooms will be full of focus, breakthroughs, and even a bit of laughter. Trust us — you won’t be thinking about the temperature once the chanters start going.</li>
        <li><strong>And If You Do Step Outside… BBQ Will Be Waiting</strong><br>
        We’re even treating you to a lunch outing at one of Kansas City’s famous barbecue joints — warm food, great company, and a well-earned break.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So yes — it’s winter. But that’s what makes this the perfect time to double down on your piping, refocus your fundamentals, and come out of hibernation with a stronger, more confident sound. You’ll be inside. You’ll be learning. You’ll be laughing. You’ll be eating ribs. You’ll be glad you came.</p>

    <h2>I don't need to go "Back to Basics"</h2>
    <p>Totally fair — but here’s the twist:</p>
    <p>This workshop isn’t about starting over… it’s about finally mastering the stuff most pipers never truly nail down.</p>
    <p>Even experienced pipers — even good ones — often skip steps early on. Fingerwork, blowing control, tuning, rhythm… it all kind of works, but it’s not rock solid. And that’s why things like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>tuning still feels inconsistent,</li>
        <li>fingers don’t always cooperate under pressure,</li>
        <li>the instrument feels hard to control or tiring to play,</li>
        <li>or you feel like you’ve plateaued.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We call it “Back to Basics” — but what we’re really doing is rebuilding your foundation using the Dojo’s proven methods that have helped thousands of pipers break through long-standing barriers. Even top-level players revisit the basics — because that’s where the breakthroughs are.</p>
    <p>And with our small group sizes, individual attention, and high-level instruction, this isn’t about remedial stuff. It’s about refining your control and getting real traction in your playing — whether you’re a beginner or a competitor.</p>
    <p>So if you're already a good player — that’s awesome. This weekend will help you become even better, faster, and more confident — with an instrument that feels easier and more consistent every time you pick it up.</p>

    <h2>“I’m not good enough yet to attend.”</h2>
    <p>That’s exactly why this workshop exists. You don’t have to be “ready” — you just have to be willing. We start from wherever you are, and walk you step-by-step through the process to build real control and confidence. No pressure. No judgment. Just steady improvement in a supportive environment.</p>
    <p>Everyone there will be working on the same core challenges, no matter how long they’ve been playing.</p>

    <h2>“I’ve already taken Dojo classes online — this would be redundant.”</h2>
    <p>If you’ve enjoyed learning online, imagine how much more effective it will be in person, with real-time feedback and hands-on coaching.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>playing more than listening,</li>
        <li>getting feedback from multiple instructors,</li>
        <li>and learning in a totally immersive, distraction-free environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Plus, you’ll connect with other Dojo students and build real community — something you can’t get from a screen.</p>

    <h2>I’d rather spend money on gear/tunes/lessons instead.</h2>
    <p>Totally fair — but here’s the thing: gear doesn’t fix bad blowing, a new tune doesn’t fix sloppy fingerwork, and lessons once a week often aren’t enough to cause real breakthroughs.</p>
    <p>This weekend gives you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>months of progress in 3 days,</li>
        <li>clear methods you can repeat on your own,</li>
        <li>and the confidence that your time and money are now going toward lasting improvement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is an investment that actually multiplies the value of everything else you’re spending on.</p>

    <h2>I can’t miss work/school/family time.</h2>
    <p>We get it — but this is a once-a-year opportunity to take focused time for yourself and your musical growth.</p>
    <p>Think of it as a mini-retreat. You’ll come home energized, inspired, and playing better — and that kind of momentum can carry you through the whole year.</p>

    <h2>I won’t know anyone — I don’t want to feel awkward.</h2>
    <p>You won’t be the only one. But you also won’t feel like a stranger for long.</p>
    <p>Our community is one of the most friendly, supportive groups in the piping world. The small class size, shared meals, and group sessions make it easy to connect. And by the end of the weekend, you’ll be leaving with new friends and practice partners.</p>

    <h2>I’ve been to other workshops and didn’t get much out of them.</h2>
    <p>We’ve heard this so many times. That’s why this workshop is different.</p>
    <p>Most events are just a bunch of random classes. Ours is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>fully structured, so each session builds on the last,</li>
        <li>focused on hands-on playing and feedback, not just talking,</li>
        <li>and designed to give you a clear roadmap for continued improvement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We’re not here to fill time — we’re here to move the needle on your playing.</p>
