    <h2>What if I need to cancel? (Refund policy)</h2>
    <blockquote><strong>Cancellation Policy & Protecting Your Investment</strong></blockquote>
    <p>*We understand that life happens — illnesses, emergencies, or travel issues can occur.* Because many of our expenses are locked in well in advance, we're unable to offer refunds for any reason.</p>
    <p>However, you can still protect your investment — and it’s easier than you might think.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consider Travel Insurance:</strong> Many attendees choose to purchase third-party travel insurance to cover their event registration, flights, and accommodations in case of unexpected issues.</li>
        <li><strong>How Much Does Insurance Cost?</strong> Plans typically cost about **5–10%** of your total trip cost.</li>
        <li><strong>What Insurance to Buy:</strong> We recommend using a travel insurance aggregator like **InsureMyTrip.com** to compare plans.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you need to cancel, you file a claim directly with the insurance provider. *We’ll provide a short letter confirming your cancellation if necessary.* Having a travel insurance policy means you don’t lose your investment.</p>
