The ideal customer for this initiative is typically an adult learner who has recently embarked on the journey of bagpiping, often as a passion project later in life. They may either be newcomers to the instrument or individuals who recognize the need to revisit foundational techniques to enhance their skills. These learners face significant challenges, as they feel that despite investing considerable time, money, and emotional energy, their progression remains stagnated and frustrating, leaving them stuck and worried that they may never succeed or that their investments will go to waste. Their specific frustrations include difficulties with fingerwork, which they cannot effectively assess or improve on their own, and a general sense that mastering the bagpipes has become an overwhelming task, despite their investments in equipment and lessons. With an increase in accessible bagpipe information, they still struggle to play a pleasing tune, yearning for genuine self-expression and camaraderie with fellow musicians while desiring a smoother, more enjoyable learning process without the accompanying frustrationâ€”ultimately aspiring to be competent rather than extraordinary. They are also inclined towards workshops that focus on foundational skills, distinguishing them from other weekend courses available in the market.
