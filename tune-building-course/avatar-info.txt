The ideal customer for our bagpiping education program is typically an adult learner who has taken up bagpiping later in life as a passion project, yet finds themselves struggling to learn new tunes effectively and in a timely manner, often feeling frustrated by their inability to memorize. Despite their significant investment of both time and money, they feel they are unable to keep pace with other pipers, which leads to a deeper fear of failing in their piping journey and having to confront their spouse about their perceived lack of progress. Although there is an increasing availability of bagpipe information, this customer still finds it challenging to learn tunes successfully and desires a method that is not only more enjoyable but also effective in helping them express themselves freely and connect with their bandmates. They are looking for a solution that allows them to overcome their struggles with learning tunes and fulfill their aspiration to become competent pipers, reflecting their bias toward quick and effective results.
