The ideal customer for our bagpiping education program consists predominantly of adult learners who have embarked on their bagpiping journey later in life as a passionate project. These individuals frequently encounter difficulties in successfully learning tunes in a timely manner, often frustrated by their inability to memorize music, which results in them falling behind their fellow pipers. They live with the worry that they may never attain success in their piping efforts, feeling disheartened by the substantial investments of time and money they have made and the fear that their sacrifices might yield no fruits, even dreading the possibility of confessing to their spouses that they are struggling to meet their ambitions. Despite the growing abundance of bagpipe resources available, they continue to find it challenging to learn tunes effectively, prompting their desire for a method that enables them to express themselves freely and experience the joy of playing alongside their bandmates. Above all, they seek a more enjoyable and efficient way to grasp tunes, emphasizing their wish for quick results to overcome their ongoing challenges and achieve their aspirations in piping.
