The ideal customer avatar is an adult learner who has embraced bagpiping later in life as a personal passion project, often feeling overwhelmed by the complexities of learning the instrument. These individuals struggle to learn tunes efficiently and have difficulty memorizing music, which hinders their ability to keep up with other pipers and leads to feelings of inadequacy despite their considerable investment of time and money. They fear that they may never become successful pipers, worrying that their efforts will ultimately go to waste and that they will have to face their spouses with the admission of failure. While there is an abundance of bagpipe information available to them, they often find it challenging to learn tunes successfully, leading to a strong desire for a more efficient and enjoyable learning approach that allows them to express themselves and enjoy camaraderie with their band mates. They are particularly biased towards solutions that offer quick results, as they want to end the struggle associated with their learning journey.
