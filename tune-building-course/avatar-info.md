The ideal customer for the Tune-Building Avatar is typically an adult learner who has embraced bagpiping later in life as a passionate pursuit, often finding themselves frustrated with the pace at which they can learn tunes. These individuals struggle to memorize tunes effectively and often feel like they are lagging behind other pipers, leading to a sense of despair that they may never achieve the level of success they desire despite their significant investment of time and money into their craft. Many harbor fears of failing in their piping journey, fearing they will disappoint their spouses by admitting to a lack of progress, and they face an overwhelming trend: while there's a wealth of bagpipe information at their fingertips, they still find it challenging to learn tunes proficiently. Their desire is to express themselves freely and to enjoy companionship while playing with their bandmates, yet they prefer a fast solution that alleviates their struggles. Although a multitude of tune tutorials exists, few cater to the need to learn any tune efficiently and enjoyably, which is ultimately what these customers seek in a solution to their learning challenges.
