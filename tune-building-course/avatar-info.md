The ideal customer for our bagpiping education program is largely composed of adult learners who have embraced bagpiping later in life as a passionate endeavor. These individuals frequently face challenges in effectively mastering tunes in a timely manner, often feeling overwhelmed by their inability to memorize music, which directly hinders their progress and ability to keep pace with fellow pipers. They carry a deep-seated fear of never achieving success in their piping journey, questioning whether their significant investments of time and money will yield any return, and dread having to confess to their spouses that they are struggling to meet their aspirations. Despite the increasing availability of bagpipe resources, they continue to find it difficult to learn tunes successfully, leading them to seek a method that would allow for not just improved proficiency but also the joy of playing alongside their bandmates. Their primary wish is for a more enjoyable and efficient approach to learning tunes, emphasizing a preference for quick results to end their ongoing struggles and achieve their goals in piping.
