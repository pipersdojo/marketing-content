<h2>I don't believe in online lessons</h2>
<p>"Don't Believe" in Online Bagpipe Lessons? Believe me, you're not the first person to have doubts about the effectiveness of online bagpipe lessons. Our school is indeed a big shift from the typical "master-->apprentice" approach to teaching bagpipes. It is indeed harder to teach certain skills over the internet (as we can't do much that's truly "hands on.") It's true, some of the "in person magic" that you can get from a truly great solo lesson or group session might not seem to be as magical in an online setting.</p>
<p>The Thought Experiment: All of these difficult challenges indeed crossed my mind one beautiful day in Playa del Carmen, Mexico... So, just over a decade ago, it became clear that I couldn't afford not to try to build the world's first "online bagpipe school." And so that's what I did (with the help of my extremely talented team, and amazing world-class instructors).</p>
<p>All of the challenging bits above are still challenging. It would be amazing if I could somehow magically reach through my computer screen and help a student whip their pipes into tune. But the reality is, these challenges have made student and teacher better as a result. And meanwhile, the positive benefits keep proving greater, and greater, and greater.</p>
<p>Dojo University is a fantastic product for bagpipers with and without access to in-person instruction: Bagpipers without access to in-person instruction can utilize Dojo U to ascend from the very first day picking up a practice chanter to becoming an advanced bagpiper. Many have already done it! Bagpipers with access to in-person instruction can supplement their in-person lessons with the Dojo.</p>
<p>The Pros List: Here's all the reasons Dojo U works so well... World-class instruction from the comfort of home, no travel, no gas money, and an immerse environment with a large community of like-minded bagpipers.</p>
<p>The Cons List: Here are the downsides... You're not in the same physical space as your instructor, and some skills that require "hands on" help are more challenging online. But we overcome this!</p>

<h2>I don't have the time or energy to practice</h2>
<p>"Totally understand that feeling — life is so full. But here’s the honest truth: most people don’t actually lack time. They lack results that feel worth the time. You know? People find time for Netflix, family, and other hobbies — and that’s awesome. But bagpiping often gets pushed aside because it hasn’t been delivering a return on that time.</p>
<p>But... what if that changed? What if every minute you practiced moved the needle in a real, tangible way? What if this time next month, you were sounding better, playing more confidently, and enjoying your music again? If the result felt real — would you find the time then? Because that’s exactly what we’re offering: a system that finally makes it click. And when it clicks, people want to make the time."</p>
