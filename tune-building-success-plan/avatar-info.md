The ideal customer for our bagpiping offerings is typically an adult learner who has discovered a passion for bagpiping later in life, viewing it as a rewarding project to dive into. These individuals often face the challenge of mastering tunes, struggling significantly with memorization and feeling unable to keep pace with more experienced pipers, which fosters a sense of frustration as they fear they may never achieve their goal of becoming a successful player despite their substantial investment of time and money. They worry about disappointing their partners by admitting their struggles, and while they have access to a wealth of bagpipe information, they still find it difficult to learn tunes effectively. Their desire lies in the ability to express themselves freely and enjoy playing alongside their bandmates, but they heavily favor solutions that can deliver results quickly. Ultimately, they seek a more enjoyable and effective method to learn tunes without the ongoing struggle.
