    <h2>I don't have the time or energy to practice</h2>
    <p><strong>Totally understand that feeling—life is so full!</strong> But here’s the honest truth: most people don’t actually lack time; they merely lack results that feel worthwhile.</p>
    
    <p>We all make time for Netflix, family, and other hobbies because they deliver satisfaction. The struggle with bagpiping often comes from not seeing tangible progress, leading to frustration.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Imagine if every minute you practiced brought measurable improvement.</strong> What if in just a month, you found yourself sounding better, playing with confidence, and truly enjoying your music again?</p>
