    <h2>I don't believe in online lessons</h2>

            **Believe me, you're not the first person to have doubts** about the effectiveness of online bagpipe lessons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our school is indeed a big shift from the typical **"master-->apprentice"** approach to teaching bagpipes. While it's true that certain skills are harder to teach online due to the lack of hands-on interaction, there’s much more to it.

            <strong>The Thought Experiment</strong>
            <br /> 
            Fancy joining me on a little journey? Picture this: a beautiful day in Playa del Carmen, sipping frozen cocktails, lost in thought about bagpiping... 
            <br />
            I imagined a better way to learn—an **online bagpipe school** that brings together enthusiasts from around the world, allowing them to connect and learn, all from the comfort of their homes.

    <h2>I don't have the time or energy to practice</h2>

        <p>
            **Totally understand that feeling** — life is so full. But here’s the honest truth: *most people don’t actually lack time; they lack results that feel worth the time.*
        </p>
        <p>
            You find time for Netflix, family, and other hobbies, right? That’s awesome! But bagpiping often gets pushed aside because it hasn’t been delivering a return on that time. 
        </p>

        <p>
            But... what if that changed?
            <br />
            What if every minute you practiced moved the needle in a real, *tangible way*?
            <br />
            What if this time next month, you were sounding better, playing more confidently, and **enjoying your music again**?
        </p>

        <p>
            If the result felt real — would you find the time then?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Because that’s exactly what we’re offering: a system that finally makes **everything click**. And when it clicks, people want to make the time.
