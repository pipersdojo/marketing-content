Our ideal customer avatar primarily consists of adult learners who have developed a passion for bagpiping later in life, driven by a desire to express themselves and connect with others through music. These individuals face significant challenges in mastering tunes, often feeling overwhelmed and unable to memorize or keep pace with their peers, leading to a pervasive sense of discouragement despite their investments of time and money. They grapple with fears of never achieving success in their pursuit of piping, fearing that their efforts may be in vain and contemplating the discomfort of admitting their struggles to supportive spouses. While they have access to an increasing array of bagpipe information and instructional resources, they remain dissatisfied with their progress, often isolated from effective guidance or community support, which exacerbates their frustration. They yearn for a more enjoyable and efficient way to learn tunes, seeking products that can simplify the learning process and alleviating the struggle associated with their hobby, allowing them to enjoy their time with bandmates or simply express themselves musically without the accompanying misery of ineffective learning methods.
