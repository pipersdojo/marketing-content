This ideal customer is typically an adult learner who has embraced bagpiping as a passion later in life, often finding themselves struggling to learn new tunes in a timely manner and unable to memorize them effectively. They feel a sense of frustration as they compare their progress with that of other pipers, leading to a belief that despite their significant investments of time and money, they might never achieve the success they desire as pipers. This customer harbors fears about their ability to succeed, worrying that their sacrifices will ultimately feel futile or that they may have to confide in a spouse about their perceived failure. With the increasing availability of bagpipe information, they still find it challenging to learn tunes successfully, fueling a desire to express themselves freely and enjoy making music with fellow bandmates. They have a strong preference for fast results, yet most existing tutorial products do not cater to their need to learn any tune effectively. Ultimately, they are seeking a more enjoyable and easier way to master tunes, hoping to alleviate the struggles they currently face in their bagpiping journey.
