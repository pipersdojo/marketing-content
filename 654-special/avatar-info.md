The ideal customer for our offerings is an adult learner who has taken up bagpiping later in life as a passion project, often struggling to find effective resources or a supportive community of fellow pipers. These individuals frequently feel discouraged because their efforts to improve have not yielded satisfactory results, leaving them unable to match the skill level of other pipers. They harbor fears of never succeeding and worry that their investment of time and money might be wasted, which can lead to uncomfortable conversations with their partners about their perceived failures. Although they have access to a growing array of bagpipe information, they still find it challenging to play a decent tune on a well-tuned bagpipe. Their desire is to express themselves freely through piping and enjoy the experience, whether solo or with others, without the accompanying frustration. They are motivated by the need for fast progress and seek a more enjoyable path in their bagpiping journey, aiming not for perfection but for a decent competence that will allow them to appreciate the music they create.
