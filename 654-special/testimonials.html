      “I've been piping for 30 plus years and struggling along the way. The Dojo U method works! My family and pets have seen and heard the improvement in my piping! That has been the best kind of feedback for me. The success of improvement builds on my desire and I look forward to the time of day I get on my pipes! Thank You Dojo!”

      “I have felt "stuck" for many months in my bagpiping level. I had used up my bag of tricks in being able to progress forward. The 11 Commandments of Mastery Course has (in just a few short weeks mind you) improved my mindset, my practice regime, and in turn my playing. I desperately needed this lifeline and for that I thank you!!”

      Through Dojo U I’m finally getting much of the formalized and theoretical training I never obtained through private instruction in the past. On top of this, I’m regularly able to have my playing constructively critiqued to continue to focus my improvement areas and moving forward. Dojo U has been very accommodating with their instruction from all sources and I feel a genuine sense of belonging with so many that participate in the various programs. Thanks Dojo U!

      “In today’s technological age, Dojo University has created an educational institution where pipers of all levels can obtain much needed instruction. Offering not only live weekly classes that suit anyone’s schedule, they also have a full back catalog of old lessons covering all aspects of piping. Living in Memphis, I am devoid of higher instruction, so the Dojo has given me an extremely affordable outlet where I can learn on my time from some of the top pipers in the world!”
