  <h3>A Better Method</h3>  
  <p>Sure, we have a lot of fun technology, but we also have a unique method of teaching (and a hunger for finding the best way to teach bagpipes). If you've failed in your efforts elsewhere, you simply must give us a try - we'll get you better, plain and simple.</p>

  <h3>Interactive Lessons</h3>  
  <p>What If You Had a Private Instructor—On Demand? Have you ever wished you had your own private instructor—ready to sit with you, show you things again and again, at your perfect tempo, as many times as you needed? Now you do. Our brand-new Interactive Player gives you that same experience, anytime you need it. Hear the tune played perfectly, watch the sheet music light up in real time, slow it down, loop tricky bars, and replay as often as you want. Practice with the music—not just next to it. We’ve just implemented this feature, and we’re rolling out interactive versions of all our most valuable lessons and tunes—with more added every week. This is hands-down the fastest, most frustration-free way to learn piping and drumming we’ve ever offered.</p>

You can even (optionally) purchase a printed book of our tunes of the week for posterity!</p>

Develop a great ear any time by simply signing on to Dojo U. Don't worry - you won't just be playing a video game all the time - we'll also have plenty of live classes to show you how to take your newly developed ear and apply that to getting your pipes sounding great!!!</p>
