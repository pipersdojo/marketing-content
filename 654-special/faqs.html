    <h2>Dojo U is clearly just for beginners. Is there anything for me, the more advanced player?</h2>
    <p>Advanced players can benefit immensely from the Dojo U methodology and community. As a matter of fact, most Dojo U methods were tried and tested during the Oran Mor days, as the band ascended out of grade 2 into Grade 1, ultimately qualifying for the world's final in 2011. <strong>Don't rule out how valuable this can be!</strong></p>
