        <li>An internet connection that supports at least <strong>5mbps download speed</strong> and <strong>1mbps upload speed</strong>. <a href="https://www.speedtest.net">Test your speed here.</a></li>

    <h2>Dojo U is clearly just for beginners. Is there anything for me, the more advanced player?</h2>
    <p><strong>Advanced players can benefit immensely from the Dojo U methodology and community.</strong> As a matter of fact – most Dojo U methods were tried and tested during the Oran Mor days, as the band ascended out of grade 2 into Grade 1, ultimately qualifying for the world's final in 2011. <strong>Don't rule out how valuable this can be!</strong></p>

    <h2>Do I have to quit my private lessons to do the Dojo?</h2>
