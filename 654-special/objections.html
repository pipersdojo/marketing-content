  <h2>I don't believe in online lessons</h2>
  <p><strong>Believe me, you're not the first person to have doubts</strong> about the effectiveness of online bagpipe lessons. Our school is a big shift from the typical <em>master-apprentice</em> approach to teaching bagpipes.</p>
  <p>Sure, it can be harder to teach certain skills over the internet without that true <em>hands-on</em> experience. And yes, some of the <em>in-person magic</em> might not seem as magical in an online setting. But let's take a step back:</p>
  
  <h3>The Thought Experiment</h3>
  <p>Imagine a world where you could participate in a bagpipe camp without the costs and challenges of travel. What if we could create an <strong>online bagpipe school</strong> that offers incredible benefits, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Continuously accessible learning throughout the year</li>
    <li>Affordability that beats traditional bagpipe camps</li>
    <li>A global community of learners</li>
    <li>The ability to integrate bagpiping into your daily routine</li>
  </ul>

  <p>With all these points in mind, Dojo University isn’t just an alternative, it’s a revolutionary approach to bagpipe education:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>World-class instruction from the comfort of home</li>
    <li>No travel necessary, no added costs</li>
    <li>Hundreds of learning opportunities every week</li>
    <li>An endless archive of resources at your fingertips</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Don't let doubt hold you back</strong> — experience the magic of online bagpipe lessons!</p>

  <h2>I don't have the time or energy to practice</h2>
  <p><strong>Totally understand that feeling</strong> — life is indeed full. But here’s the honest truth: most people don’t actually lack time. They lack results that feel worth the time.</p>
  <p>You make time for Netflix, family, and other hobbies — and that's awesome. However, bagpiping often gets pushed aside because it hasn’t been delivering the satisfaction that you deserve.</p>
  <p>But what if that changed? What if every minute you practiced:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Could boost your skills quickly?</li>
    <li>Made you feel more confident in your playing?</li>
    <li>Put the joy back into your music?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If <strong>the result felt real</strong> — would you find the time to practice then? Because that’s exactly what we’re offering: a system that makes it click. When it clicks, you’ll want to make the time!</p>

  <h2>The price is too high</h2>
  <p>At just $30 per month, you might wonder if it’s a stretch, especially with subscription services everywhere! But let’s compare: </p>
  <p>Most people fork out at least $50 for a single one-hour lesson. <strong>For just $30, you gain access to:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Up to 15 hours of world-renowned piping instruction</li>
    <li>An extensive library of tunes and resources</li>
    <li>A vibrant community for support and feedback</li>
    <li>Unlimited feedback on your recordings</li>
    <li>The complete beginner's tutor, and much more!</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>This subscription is WORTH IT!</strong> Don’t miss out on a chance to elevate your bagpiping journey!</p>
