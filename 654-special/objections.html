  <h2>I don't believe in online lessons</h2>
  <p>Believe me, you're not the first person to have doubts about the effectiveness of online bagpipe lessons.</p>
  <p>Our school is indeed a big shift from the typical <strong>“master-->apprentice”</strong> approach to teaching bagpipes. It is indeed harder to teach certain skills over the internet, as we can't do much that's truly <strong>“hands-on.”</strong></p>
  
  <p>It’s true, some of the <strong>“in person magic”</strong> that you can get from a truly great solo lesson or group session might not seem to be as magical in an online setting.</p>

  <h3>The Thought Experiment</h3>
  <p>All of these difficult challenges crossed my mind one beautiful day in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. It was the year 2011, and my wife and I were on our honeymoon. I was daydreaming about bagpipe stuff.</p>
  <p>What if somehow we could make online bagpipe lessons work? Here are some incredible benefits:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Experience bagpiping for <strong>52 weeks per year</strong> instead of just one week at camp.</li>
    <li>Access to sessions from the <strong>world’s best pipers</strong> without the need for travel.</li>
    <li>Save on commute, gas money, and health risks.</li>
    <li>Develop a <strong>community of pipers</strong> that grows together over time.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>With Dojo University, you can access world-class instruction at your convenience.</p>

  <h2>I don't have the time or energy to practice</h2>
  <p>Totally understand that feeling — life is so full! But here’s the honest truth: <strong>most people don’t actually lack time.</strong> They lack results that feel worth the time.</p>
  
  <p>What if every minute you practiced moved the needle in a real, tangible way? What if this time next month, you were sounding better, playing more confidently, and enjoying your music again?</p>
  
  <p>If the result felt real — would you find the time then? Because that’s exactly what we’re offering: a system that finally makes it click. And when it clicks, people want to <strong>make the time.</strong></p>

  <h2>The price is too high</h2>
  <p>$30 per month can certainly be a stretch, especially in this era of subscription life! However, compare this to what most people pay for world-class instruction. It’s usually at least <strong>$50 for a single one-hour lesson</strong>, if not more!</p>
  
  <p>For just $30, you'll have access to up to <strong>15 hours</strong> of world-renowned piping instruction, an endless library of tunes, a vibrant community, unlimited feedback on your recordings, and even the complete beginner's tutor.</p>
  
  <p>This subscription is <strong>WORTH IT!</strong></p>
